U.S. solar installations&nbsp;hit a record&nbsp;high in 2020, but yearly solar capacity additions will need to double annually through 2025, before quadrupling from 2020′s level each year between 2025 and 2030. Falling costs and supportive policies including tax incentives have boosted solar’s robust growth over the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
